Dental Portfolio

Rehab case

The case that I enjoyed and proud of the most was a rehab case for a woman presented with failed long-span bridge from 7| to |5 (patient had coronary artery insufficiency ) and multiple failed endodontic treatments and loss of VDO. So we started with removing caries and calculus to evaluate remaining tooth structure then re-treatment of the failed endodontic treatments followed by gingivectomy using LASER Then post and core followed by preparing the teeth for temporization along with RPD for elevating the bite to regain the lost VDO follow up after 3 months showed almost regained VDO , and after it was fully regained we proceeded to deliver the final bridge with success .

Patient encouragement and low stress management played a huge role in the treatment.

Note: shade wss selected according to patient's desire.
